Simplify debts by minimizing transactions. The algorithm does not aim in minimizing transaction amounts but only the number of transactions.


Run:
----

1. Create debts file, e.g. debts.txt:
# Everyone owes Joe
* -> Joe: 16.80
Sue -> Joe: 24.40
Bob -> Sue: 12.20
# Ellen is part of everyone
Ellen

2. Run:
$ src/simplify.py <debts.txt
Bob -> Joe: 16.4
Sue -> Joe: 16.4
Ellen -> Joe: 4.2

Run with graphviz:
------------------

$ src/simplify.py -g <debts.txt |dot -Tpng >debts.png
